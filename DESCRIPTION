Description: Targeted function balancing, or TFB, is a statistical method
    for causal inference. tfb is the official package for the
    implementation of TFB into the programming language R. TFB Targets a
    predictive Function and Balances observations to determine its final
    estimate. TFB thereby transforms the question of how best to weight
    observational study data into how best to model the relationships in
    that data.
